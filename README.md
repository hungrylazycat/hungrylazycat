Hungry Lazy Cat is a unique yet universal cat. The author is a professional artist who prefers to stay anonymous. 
The Hungry Lazy Cat project was created in February 2021. It is an NFT cartoon. The creator’s vision of an NFT cartoon/comic is to provide a complete story/joke in a unique image, combining the integrity of a joke/story with the non fungibility of a token. It is understood that the cat is not a cat in particular, but the essence of one. Every cartoon depicts the same yet different cat and is independent. Whether the cat is male or a female is not relevant.

The comic’s design is purposefully simple. There is no need for intricacy here, the brain should be able to instantly analyse the situation and the emotions depicted. The three-step conception of humour is usually respected, but with a little twist :  introductory framing of the joke (the cat’s behaviour, facial expression or characteristics),  the narrative (the situation), and the punchline (the text in the image). The only difference is that the punchline is double, thanks to the title of the piece. The reader’s natural process follows the steps, attracted first by the character, then observing its environment, reading the text in the image, and finally the title.
The colors are kept soft and the typography natural to provide a sense of general calm and allow the reader to enjoy a relaxing, joyful, funny experience. 
The author produces an average of 5 cartoons a week, and sells the most popular ones arbitrarily.

Purchasing one of the NFT implies that you adopt the corresponding cat, it is then your responsibility to tend to the well being of your immaterial companion as you best see fit. 

The owner’s ethereum’s address will be displayed in the galleries, online or IRL. The owner can oppose any but one commercial usage of its cat’s image, namely the display of a downgraded version of it on the creator’s social media. Owners can contact the creator through a social media account to exercise their rights.

Have a good time reading Hungry Lazy Cat and feel free to adopt one of the cats.
